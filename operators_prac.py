# arthmetic operators 
# Example : 1
a = 10
b = 5
sum = (a+b)
diff = (a-b)
prod = (a*b)
div = (a/b)
mod = (a%b)
exp = (a**b)
print(sum)

print(prod)
print(div)
print(mod)
# we can write the arthmetic operator directly
a = 2
b = 4
print(a+b) 
print(a-b) 
print(a*b) 
print(a/b) 
print(a%b) 



# relational operators
a = 5
b = 10
print(a==b)
# equal to
print(a!=b)
# not equal to
print(a>b)
# greater than
print(a<b)
# less than
print(a>=b)
# greater than or equal to
print(a<=b)
# less than or equal to
