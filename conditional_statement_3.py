# # this code indicates about the conditional statements in python, which is mainly used in decision making
# # example code 1
# light = input("light colour =")
# if(light == "red"):
#     print("stop")
# elif(light == "yellow"):
#     print("get ready")
# elif(light == "green"):
#     print("go")
# else:
#     print("if light is broken")


# # example code 2
# marks = input("marks :")
# if(marks >= "90"):
#     print("grade A")
# elif(marks >= "80" and marks < "90"):
#     print("grade B")
# elif(marks >= "70" and marks < "80"):
#     print("grade C")
# else:
#     print("fail")
# # in the above code the input statement always return the string not the integer value
# # in the code the "and" operator is used to combine two conditions together


# # example code 3
# a = input("a :")
# g = input("f/m :")
# if((a == 2 or a == 1) and g == "m"):
#     print("fee is 200")
# elif(a == 3 or a == 5 or g == "f"):
#     print("fee is 300")
# elif(a == 4 and g == "m"):
#     print("fee is 400")
# else:
#     print("no fee")



# # this codes comes under ternary operator also known as the single line comment in python 
# # we can write in two ways 
# food = input("food :")
# order = "yes" if food == "cake" else "no"
# print(order)

# # first by assigning the variable value in it 

# food = input("food :")
# print("sweet") if(food == "cake" or food == "icecream") else print("not sweet")
# # second by directly using print statement in it




# # this code also part of the ternary operator but in different way, also known as the "clever if" statement
# a = int(input("age :"))
# vote = ("yes","no") [a >= 18]
# print(vote)




# # we can write a clever if statement in 2 ways...
# sal = float(input("salary :"))
# tax = sal *(0.1,0.2) [sal > 50000]
# print(tax)

# sal = float(input("salary :"))
# tax = sal * (0.1 if sal <= 50000 else 0.2)
# print(tax)
